# javascript blockchain

this is a simple project that I hope to expand to gain a greater understanding of cryptography, relevant data structures, and potentially distributed systems.

## starting point

i began following [this article](https://medium.com/@spenserhuang/learn-build-a-javascript-blockchain-part-1-ca61c285821e) and found it to be a good starting point to begin a mental model of how blockchains work. i fixed a few flaws in the block constructor, and then began expanding on where he left off because there is no part two.

## next steps

* i need to gain greater understanding of transactions to build a simplified transaction class. currently need to learn about public / private key cryptography to understand how that plays in a transaction.
* i'm unsure if should at this point have a wallet class separate from a transaction class.
* then i need to put the transactions together in a merkle tree! i have a basic understanding of merkle trees, and could just use an existing merkle tree library, but i think it would be beneficial for me to construct and understand traversing merkle trees rather than just using a library.
